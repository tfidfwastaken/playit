* todo pls
** Player
- Will use the racket portaudio package for playing sounds.
- Need to figure out how to decode files so that portaudio can play it, potentially write my own ffi bindings (oof)
  - At the moment libsndfile can decode just about everything except mp3 â€” mp3 decoding is on its way but no ETA
  - mpg123 does /only/ mp3 decoding (-.-)
  
** Interface
   Create the command line interface using =raart=
**** Current proposal
#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ pls /path/to/file.mp3  # plays the song
[display metadata]
[======>                           ]
[SPC] pause/play | [</>] seek | [n]ext | [p]rev

pls peek /path/to/file.mp3  # preview track
#+END_SRC
