* todo pls
** Player
- +figure out if =ffplay= can pause, seek etc+ update: nope 
- Better idea: have a look at =ffi/unsafe= and try to make bindings for =ffmpeg=
  - Learn this stuff
    - +Learn ffmpeg bindings for audio+ nope too insane. Will need to use a simpler library.
- Attempt =vlc= racket package. Failed miserably. Looks like there is no escaping the dirty low level stuff.
- Make this project into bindings for libsnd instead of a music player??
  
** Interface
   Create the command line interface
**** Current proposal (deprecated idea)
#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ pls /path/to/file.mp3  # plays the song
[display metadata]
[SPC] pause/play | [</>] seek | [n]ext | [p]rev

#+END_SRC
